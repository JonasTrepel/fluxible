pass gas measurement frequency as argument in fitting functions to avoid unnecessary warnings
use user's columns names instead of renaming
graphs on american paper format
give choice to overwrite plot or not
giga warp up function doing the fitting, quality, and plot to test different cuts and quality thresholds
make flux_fitting_exp more resilient in case of issue with optim in one flux (so far it crashes the entire thing, would prefer to take out the problematic flux and fit the rest)
add vertical line in plot for tz
actions on other columns in flux_calc: mean (done), sum, median
flux_calc: automatically keep f_start column
flux_fitting: make it so that estimates for optim and optim are arguments, so users who want to build their own model/estimations can do it


IMPORTANT FIXES
fixed flux_calc: filter out cuts otherwise it calculates two fluxes (keep and cut)
